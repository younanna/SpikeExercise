## Journal 1
Since it is my first time developing android application, I started with installing Android Studio and learned how to run it on the android virtual device. I created a basic features such as changing text and creating a button on the interface.
On Android developer website, I learned what each file in the project file does. All the features I created or changed are reflected on the android virtual device, Pixel 2 API 29.
I moved on to connect the project with git repository as public. It is all set to start coding now.

## Journal 2: Log in page
I create the login interface with features like entering id and password and login button. It takes time to figure out a way to switch pages by clicking a button. I creates a new activity in Layout folder which automatically creates a new layout/page for me!
I create a button on a new page and linked it to login page by writing a function 'onclick'.
When I enter id and password and click Login button, it passes and displays id and password on a new page.
